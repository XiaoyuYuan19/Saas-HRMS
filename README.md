# Development of human resource management system based on SaaS model
**Abstract: **With the continuous development of the Internet, companies have gradually developed from traditional human resource management to informatized and digitalized human resource management. However, small and medium- sized enterprises cannot afford the costs incurred in the later operation and maintenance of the human resource management system, software and hardware environment deployment, and system upgrades. The emergence of SaaS software as a service solves this problem. Enterprises can rent software only for a small fee, which greatly reduces the cost of enterprise digitization. This paper explores the development model of human resource management system based on SaaS model, studies the current information system development technology of SaaS model, and uses SpringBoot, Mybatis and other technologies to build a human resource management system based on SaaS model.

**Key words: **SaaS model; human resource management; SpringBoot framework; microservices
